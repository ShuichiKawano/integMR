# Sparse multivariate regression in integrative analysis (integMR)
Author: Shuichi Kawano, Daeju Kim, and Yoshiyuki Ninomiya

This is an R source code for performing smoothing varying regularization (SVaRu). The directory *R* includes many files that perform SVaRu. Among them, most important file is given as follows.
- **SVaRu.R** provides SVaRu with the values of tuning parameters selected by generalized information criterion. 

SVaRu is introduced in the paper:
Kim, D., Kawano, S. and Ninomiya, Y. (2023) Smoothly varying regularization. *Computational Statistics & Data Analysis*. **179**, 107644 (doi:[ 10.1016/j.csda.2022.107644](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2022.107644)).

The zip file "SimulationRealdata.zip" also includes source codes to perform simulations and real data analysis in the above paper.
