Author: Shuichi Kawano, Toshikazu Fukushima, Junichi Nakagawa, Mamoru Oshiki

This is an R source code for performing sparse multivariate regression in integrative analysis (integMR). The directory *R* includes many files that perform integMR. Among them, most important file is given as follows.
- **integMR.R** provides SVaRu with the values of tuning parameters selected by generalized information criterion. 

integMR is introduced in the paper:
